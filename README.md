- **Persona Cards:** Each persona is displayed as a card on the main page, providing a brief overview and an image associated with that persona.

- **Persona Details:** Clicking on a persona card opens a detailed view, where you can provide more information, images, and descriptions about that particular persona.

- **Responsive Layout:** The portfolio is built with a responsive design, ensuring it looks great and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.
